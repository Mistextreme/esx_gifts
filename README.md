Hi, this is something i whipped up quickly for our communitys Christmas Event. 

It's quite simple to use. 

Using the items gives randomized items / money to your player. 

You can modify the chances, items and amounts to your preference, and add new random items / money prizes in server.lua

I got the idea from https://github.com/michaelhodgejr/esx_scratchoffs 
and modified it to my preference. 
I did not ask author if i can release this, though I'm not sure if its even necessary. 
If so, you can take this post down. 

I suggest you add some logs for prizes, but thats all up to you to do
